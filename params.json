This is essentially a complete reproduction of [Ryan Bates' Authentication from Scratch railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch) with my addition of RSpec unit and integration tests. In addition to authentication, features include rememberable cookie and password reset.\r\n\r\nSee the 'rails-3.0' tag for a legacy Rails 3.0 implementation.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n    rake setup\r\n    bundle exec rake\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
