{"name":"Decent Authentication","body":"[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/leesmith/decent_authentication.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/leesmith/decent_authentication)\r\n\r\nDecent Authentication is a sample application that implements authentication in Rails 3.1 without the use of a third-party generator or engine.  This is essentially a complete reproduction of [Ryan Bates' Authentication from Scratch railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch) with my addition of RSpec unit and integration tests. In addition to authentication, features include rememberable cookie and password reset.\r\n\r\nSee the 'rails-3.0' tag for a legacy Rails 3.0 implementation.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/leesmith/decent_authentication.git\r\n    cp config/database.[mysql|postgres].yml config/database.yml\r\n    gem install bundler && bundle\r\n    rake db:setup","tagline":"Rails authentication from scratch","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
