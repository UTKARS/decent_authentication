<em>Authentication from scratch.</em>

This is an implementation of authentication in Rails 3.1 without the use of a third-party generator or engine.  This is essentially a complete reproduction of {Ryan Bates' Authentication from Scratch railscast}[http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch] with my addition of RSpec unit and integration tests. In addition to authentication, features include rememberable cookie and password reset.

See the 'rails-3.0' tag for a legacy Rails 3.0 implementation.
