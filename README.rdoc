= Decent Authentication

<em>Authentication from scratch.</em>

This is an implementation of authentication in Rails 3 without the use of a generator or engine.  This is essentially a complete reproduction of {Ryan Bates' Authentication from Scratch railscast}[http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch] with my addition of cucumber tests.
